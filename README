 Purpose: For preparing data from the MSLR LeToR data set for our teams specific needs (pairwise LeToR)
 
 Data here: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/mslr/download.aspx
  - Converts from given format to csv (including qid)
  - Samples csv (with qid) so that for each query there are a max of n documents at each relevance rating
  - Converts csv file (with qid) to pairwise difference file (csv no qid)
  --------------------------------
 
  Designed to be used as a [clumsy] command line tool.  Some invalid inputs will cause a crash.  Run with no options to see
  usage information.
 
  --------------------------------
  If you want to use the final pairwise output as an .arff the header should be:
  @attribute label {0,1,2,3,4}
  @attribute attrN numeric  // for n 0 - 94
  ...
  @attribute attrN {-1,0,1} // for n 95-99
  ...
  @attribute attrN numeric // for n 100-135    
  
  Create the header in mydata.arff then cat <thisprogramoutputfile> >> mydata.arff
  then you should be able to use this format with weka etc
